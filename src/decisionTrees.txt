Main Hall;&DECISION_START;&The dimly lit Main Hall of Mount Dark Asylum looms before you. A restless patient holds a keycard. A foreboding, old wheelchair is nearby. What's your first move?;&[Approach the patient:DECISION_INTERACT_WITH_PATIENT], [Inspect the wheelchair:DECISION_INSPECT_WHEELCHAIR], [Exit the asylum:DECISION_TRY_EXIT_ASYLUM_FATAL]
Main Hall;&DECISION_TRY_EXIT_ASYLUM_FATAL;&Resolved to leave this nightmare behind, you head towards the main doors, pushing against them with all your might. As they creak open, a figure steps from the shadows behind you - the same older man you saw earlier, his robe casting a ghostly silhouette. "I'm sorry, my son, I didn't want to have to do this to you. But you can't leave, not yet. There is so much yet for you to witness," he intones solemnly, as an unseen force pulls you back into the darkness of the asylum.;&
Main Hall;&DECISION_INTERACT_WITH_PATIENT;&Approaching the patient, you notice his erratic behavior. He clutches the keycard tightly, murmuring incomprehensibly. How do you proceed?;&[Attempt conversation:DECISION_ATTEMPT_CONVERSATION], [Observe from a distance:DECISION_OBSERVE_FROM_DISTANCE], [Stealthily grab the keycard:DECISION_STEALTH_GRAB]

Main Hall;&DECISION_OBSERVE_FROM_DISTANCE;&Keeping your distance, you watch the patient. Suddenly, he looks straight at you, whispering, "You're not one of them, are you?" before returning to his mutterings.;&[Approach cautiously:DECISION_INTERACT_WITH_PATIENT], [Examine something else:DECISION_START]
Main Hall;&DECISION_INSPECT_WHEELCHAIR;&The wheelchair creaks ominously as you draw near. It's empty but feels like it holds a thousand stories. You notice something scratched on its arm.;&[Examine the scratches:DECISION_EXAMINE_SCRATCHES], [Look elsewhere:DECISION_START]

Main Hall;&DECISION_ECHO_SOURCE_FATAL;&Tracking the echo, you find an old, blood-stained straitjacket. As you examine it, a deranged figure emerges, screaming, "You can't hide the truth!" You stumble backward, falling into darkness.;&
Main Hall;&DECISION_STEALTH_GRAB;&You carefully try to take the keycard. The patient grabs you, whispering, "They're always watching..." and releases you. You flee, keycard in hand.;&[END:DECISION_END]
Patient Wards;&DECISION_START;&The eerie silence of the abandoned Patient Wards chills you to the bone. A nurse clutches papers in the corner, and distant echoes hint at hidden dangers.

Patient Wards;&DECISION_EXAMINE_PAPERS;&The papers are a mix of medical records and nonsensical notes. One phrase stands out, scrawled repeatedly: "They never leave." A chill runs down your spine.;&[Question the nurse:DECISION_COMMUNICATE_NURSE], [Put the papers back:DECISION_START]
Patient Wards;&DECISION_INVESTIGATE_ECHOES;&You follow the haunting echoes to a secluded area. The sounds cease abruptly, leaving you in unsettling silence.;&[Search the area:DECISION_SEARCH_AREA], [Retreat to the main ward:DECISION_START]

As he drags you into darkness, his growling voice echoes, "Little pig, little pig, no more escape.";&
Patient Wards;&DECISION_SEARCH_NURSE;&You cautiously search the nurse. Among her possessions, you find a crumpled note with a cryptic message: "Beware the watcher." The note leaves you uneasy.;&[Ponder the warning:DECISION_START], [Continue exploring:DECISION_START]

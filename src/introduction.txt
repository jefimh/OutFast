[Your consciousness flickers back like a dimly lit candle in a vast darkness. 
Memories slowly stitch themselves together - you are an investigative 
journalist, driven by the whispers of scandal at Mount Dark Asylum. The 
moments leading up to this point, however, remain blurred and lost.]

[As your eyes struggle against the darkness, they catch a faint, flickering light 
above. Every inch of your body aches, hinting at a fall from a great height, but 
the details are frustratingly vague. You shift slightly, and a sharp pain in your 
back brings a stifled groan to your lips.]

[Suddenly, a figure materializes from the shadows, his presence both eerie and 
intriguing. He is an older man, with a worn face marked by deep lines of age or 
stress. His eyes, intense yet distant, fix upon you. A simple robe drapes over his 
frame, giving him the air of a religious figure. In his hand, he holds a candle, 
its light casting an otherworldly glow on his features.]

FIGURE: "And who are you then?"

[Your throat is dry, making speech difficult.]

[The figure steps forward, his movements deliberate. He regards you with a mix 
of curiosity and solemnity, then speaks with a voice that resonates against the 
stone walls.]

FIGURE: "I see, merciful God, you have sent me an apostle. Guard your life, son. 
You have a calling."

[With those cryptic words, the man turns away, his figure retreating into the 
dark corridors of the asylum, leaving you in the shadow of his proclamation.]

[The room spins with unspoken questions and fears, but above all, a pressing 
need for survival looms. You must get out of this dangerous and scary place safely]
